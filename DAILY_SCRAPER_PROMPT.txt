DAILY JOB SCRAPER - MORNING PROMPT
===================================

Use one of these prompts each morning to run the job scraper and get a summary:


OPTION 1 - Short version:
-------------------------
Run the job scraper, compare results to yesterday, and give me:
1. New job counts vs yesterday by company
2. Summary of new job postings for each company


OPTION 2 - More explicit:
-------------------------
Run scrape_all_companies.py, then do a direct CSV comparison between today and yesterday's job data. Show me:
1. A table with yesterday's count, today's count, new jobs, and removed jobs per company
2. A summary of the new job postings grouped by company with job titles and locations


OPTION 3 - One-liner:
---------------------
Run the daily job scraper and summarize new postings vs yesterday
